Download is available at https://grinnr.itch.io/steed install instructions are there also :)

When you open/download Steed you may receive a notification from Windows and or your antivirus.
This is because Steed still does not have certification. Certificates cost alot, and right now;
being a student, I do not have the budget to pay for the annual fee of a certificate. So please
don't worry, Steed is completely safe and doesn't have malicious intentions, this is a passion project.

You may also run into crashes and or bugs as Steed is still in development, if you experience any of these
please notify me on the Steed Discord in #bugs. If you have any suggestions please tell me in #suggestions.

Thanks for taking time to read this and enjoy Steed!
